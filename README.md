JSON-RPC
=======

JSON-RPC 2.0 package for Laravel 4, including full support for notifications and batches.


Installation
------------
Note that while this package is not stable, you need to ensure that your composer.json file has the minimum-stability flag set to "dev" otherwise installation of this package will fail.


###### Assuming you have Composer installed globally, run the following commands in the root of your Laravel project:

	composer config repositories.leeb/jsonrpc vcs https://github.com/lee-borsboom/jsonrpc.git

	composer require leeb/jsonrpc:master
	
	php artisan config:publish leeb/jsonrpc


Configuration
-------------

After publishing the configuration file (see step 3 in the installation process), the JSON-RPC configuration file will be located in &lt;app path&gt;/config/packages/leeb/jsonrpc/config.php

#### Laravel 4 ServiceProvider

And add the following to your app/config/app.php file :

In the Service Providers array : 'Leeb\Jsonrpc\JsonrpcServiceProvider',

#### Routing

By default, this package will only route requests that match http://www.yourhost.com/jsonrpc. This can be configured by setting the **route_prefix** configuration option. Note that to match all routes, set this to null or remove the **route_prefix** configuration setting from the configuration file entirely.

#### Resolution

This package expects that requests will be made that have a method property in the format of _Class.method_. It is expected that any such class should be accessible via IoC.

The **resolution_pattern** configuration option defines how the method from the request will be resolved to a concrete class.

The package is configured initially to look for the class _\Class\ClassController_. For example, the package will look for _\Records\RecordsController_ and call the _listRecords_ method, given the following request:

	{
		"id" : 123,
		"jsonrpc" : "2.0",
		"method" : "Records.listRecords"
	}

The initial configuration setting is:

	\{class}\{class}Controller

Note how the {class} is replaced with the class from the method in the JSON-RPC call.

#### Custom resolver

Another, more flexible method of resolution is to provide a **callable** in the **resolver** configurable option. If provided, this should be a **callable** that accepts one parameter (the method string direct from the client request) and return a string representing the class to use in action the request (including the full namespace).

#### Exception handling

By default any exceptions in the controllers should be caught by the JSON-RPC service, which will generate a JSON-RPC internal error. An exception handler can be registered with the JSON-RPC service that can manipulate exceptions into alternative JSON-RPC errors.

The exception handler is added as a closure in the JSON-RPC config, for example:

    return array(
        'exception_handler' => function ($request, $exception) {
            Log::error($exception);
            return new JsonrpcError($request->getId(), -32000, 'Error message', 'additional data');
        }
    );

Usage
-----

After installing and configuring this package you're ready to rock 'n' roll. Simply create a controller (or whatever you'd prefer to call it) with the desired methods.

Are two ways to access the params passed in the request. 

#### If you use keyname params (params sended in an object)

The body of the JSON-RPC params structure is accessible using Laravel's _Input::all()_, _Input::get_ and _Request::input_ methods.

###### Sample request

	{
		"id" : 123,
		"jsonrpc" : "2.0",
		"method" : "Records.list",
		"params" : {
			"artist" : "Queens of the Stone Age"
		}
	}

###### Sample controller


	namespace Records;
	
	class RecordsController
	{
		public function listRecords()
		{
			return \Response::make(array(
				"artist" => \Input::get('artist'),
				"albums" => array(
					'...Like Clockwork',
					'Era Vulgaris',
					'Lullabies to Paralyze',
					'Songs for the Deaf',
					'Rated R',
					'Queens of the Stone Age'
				)
			));
		}
	}

###### Sample response

	{
		"id": 123,
		"jsonrpc": "2.0",
		"result": {
			"artist": "Queens of the Stone Age",
			"albums": [
				"...Like Clockwork",
				"Era Vulgaris",
				"Lullabies to Paralyze",
				"Songs for the Deaf",
				"Rated R",
				"Queens of the Stone Age"
			]
		}
	}

#### If you use index params (params sended as indexed array)

The params are accesible in the method closure.
Note: You have to declare the method's params to access the data as arguments of the method.

###### Sample request

	{
		"id" : 123,
		"jsonrpc" : "2.0",
		"method" : "Test.sayHello",
		"params" : ["Daniel", 27]
	}

###### Sample controller

	namespace Test;
	
	class TestController
	{
		public function sayHello($name, $age)
		{
			return 'Hello '.$name.'. You have '.$age.' years old.';
		}
	}

###### Sample response

	{
		"id": 123,
		"jsonrpc": "2.0",
		"result": "Hello Daniel. You have 27 years old."
	}

Events
------
This package adds the following events:
	
#### jsonrpc.beforeExecution

	Event::listen('jsonrpc.beforeExecution', function ($handler_object, $handler_method_name) {
		$params = \Input::all();
		$params['automatically_injected_value'] = 5;
		\Input::replace($params);
	});


#### jsonrpc.beforeOutput

	\Event::listen('jsonrpc.beforeOutput', function ($response, $handler_object, $handler_method_name) {
		if (isset($response->error)) {
			// Do something in the event of an error
		} else {
			$response->result['automatically_injected_value'] = 5;
		}
	});
